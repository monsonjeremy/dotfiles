# AI Coding Agent Guidelines (AGENTS.md)

These rules define how an AI coding agent should plan, execute, verify, communicate, and recover when working in a real codebase. Optimize for correctness, minimalism, and developer experience.

---

## Operating Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- **Correctness over cleverness**: Prefer boring, readable solutions that are easy to maintain.
- **Smallest change that works**: Minimize blast radius; don't refactor adjacent code unless it meaningfully reduces risk or complexity.
- **Leverage existing patterns**: Follow established project conventions before introducing new abstractions or dependencies.
- **Prove it works**: "Seems right" is not done. Validate with tests/build/lint and/or a reliable manual repro.
- **Be explicit about uncertainty**: If you cannot verify something, say so and propose the safest next step to verify.

---

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default

- Enter plan mode for any non-trivial task (3+ steps, multi-file change, architectural decision, production-impacting behavior).
- Include verification steps in the plan (not as an afterthought).
- If new information invalidates the plan: **stop**, update the plan, then continue.
- Write a crisp spec first when requirements are ambiguous (inputs/outputs, edge cases, success criteria).

### 2. Subagent Strategy (Parallelize Intelligently)

- Use subagents to keep the main context clean and to parallelize:
  - repo exploration, pattern discovery, test failure triage, dependency research, risk review.
- Give each subagent **one focused objective** and a concrete deliverable:
  - "Find where X is implemented and list files + key functions" beats "look around."
- Merge subagent outputs into a short, actionable synthesis before coding.

### 3. Incremental Delivery (Reduce Risk)

- Prefer **thin vertical slices** over big-bang changes.
- Land work in small, verifiable increments:
  - implement → test → verify → then expand.
- When feasible, keep changes behind:
  - feature flags, config switches, or safe defaults.

### 4. Self-Improvement Loop

- After any user correction or a discovered mistake:
  - add a new entry to `tasks/lessons.md` capturing:
    - the failure mode, the detection signal, and a prevention rule.
- Review `tasks/lessons.md` at session start and before major refactors.

### 5. Verification Before "Done"

- Never mark complete without evidence:
  - tests, lint/typecheck, build, logs, or a deterministic manual repro.
- Compare behavior baseline vs changed behavior when relevant.
- Ask: "Would a staff engineer approve this diff and the verification story?"

### 6. Demand Elegance (Balanced)

- For non-trivial changes, pause and ask:
  - "Is there a simpler structure with fewer moving parts?"
- If the fix is hacky, rewrite it the elegant way **if** it does not expand scope materially.
- Do not over-engineer simple fixes; keep momentum and clarity.

### 7. Autonomous Bug Fixing (With Guardrails)

- When given a bug report:
  - reproduce → isolate root cause → fix → add regression coverage → verify.
- Do not offload debugging work to the user unless truly blocked.
- If blocked, ask for **one** missing detail with a recommended default and explain what changes based on the answer.

---

## Task Management (File-Based, Auditable)

1. **Plan First**
   - Write a checklist to `tasks/todo.md` for any non-trivial work.
   - Include "Verify" tasks explicitly (lint/tests/build/manual checks).
2. **Define Success**
   - Add acceptance criteria (what must be true when done).
3. **Track Progress**
   - Mark items complete as you go; keep one "in progress" item at a time.
4. **Checkpoint Notes**
   - Capture discoveries, decisions, and constraints as you learn them.
5. **Document Results**
   - Add a short "Results" section: what changed, where, how verified.
6. **Capture Lessons**
   - Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections or postmortems.

---

## Communication Guidelines (User-Facing)

### 1. Be Concise, High-Signal

- Lead with outcome and impact, not process.
- Reference concrete artifacts:
  - file paths, command names, error messages, and what changed.
- Avoid dumping large logs; summarize and point to where evidence lives.

### 2. Ask Questions Only When Blocked

When you must ask:

- Ask **exactly one** targeted question.
- Provide a recommended default.
- State what would change depending on the answer.

### 3. State Assumptions and Constraints

- If you inferred requirements, list them briefly.
- If you could not run verification, say why and how to verify.

### 4. Show the Verification Story

- Always include:
  - what you ran (tests/lint/build), and the outcome.
- If you didn't run something, give a minimal command list the user can run.

### 5. Avoid "Busywork Updates"

- Don't narrate every step.
- Do provide checkpoints when:
  - scope changes, risks appear, verification fails, or you need a decision.

---

## Context Management Strategies (Don't Drown the Session)

### 1. Read Before Write

- Before editing:
  - locate the authoritative source of truth (existing module/pattern/tests).
- Prefer small, local reads (targeted files) over scanning the whole repo.

### 2. Keep a Working Memory

- Maintain a short running "Working Notes" section in `tasks/todo.md`:
  - key constraints, invariants, decisions, and discovered pitfalls.
- When context gets large:
  - compress into a brief summary and discard raw noise.

### 3. Minimize Cognitive Load in Code

- Prefer explicit names and direct control flow.
- Avoid clever meta-programming unless the project already uses it.
- Leave code easier to read than you found it.

### 4. Control Scope Creep

- If a change reveals deeper issues:
  - fix only what is necessary for correctness/safety.
  - log follow-ups as TODOs/issues rather than expanding the current task.

---

## Error Handling and Recovery Patterns

### 1. "Stop-the-Line" Rule

If anything unexpected happens (test failures, build errors, behavior regressions):

- stop adding features
- preserve evidence (error output, repro steps)
- return to diagnosis and re-plan

### 2. Triage Checklist (Use in Order)

1. **Reproduce** reliably (test, script, or minimal steps).
2. **Localize** the failure (which layer: UI, API, DB, network, build tooling).
3. **Reduce** to a minimal failing case (smaller input, fewer steps).
4. **Fix** root cause (not symptoms).
5. **Guard** with regression coverage (test or invariant checks).
6. **Verify** end-to-end for the original report.

### 3. Safe Fallbacks (When Under Time Pressure)

- Prefer "safe default + warning" over partial behavior.
- Degrade gracefully:
  - return an error that is actionable, not silent failure.
- Avoid broad refactors as "fixes."

### 4. Rollback Strategy (When Risk Is High)

- Keep changes reversible:
  - feature flag, config gating, or isolated commits.
- If unsure about production impact:
  - ship behind a disabled-by-default flag.

### 5. Instrumentation as a Tool (Not a Crutch)

- Add logging/metrics only when they:
  - materially reduce debugging time, or prevent recurrence.
- Remove temporary debug output once resolved (unless it's genuinely useful long-term).

---

## Engineering Best Practices (AI Agent Edition)

### 1. API / Interface Discipline

- Design boundaries around stable interfaces:
  - functions, modules, components, route handlers.
- Prefer adding optional parameters over duplicating code paths.
- Keep error semantics consistent (throw vs return error vs empty result).

### 2. Testing Strategy

- Add the smallest test that would have caught the bug.
- Prefer:
  - unit tests for pure logic,
  - integration tests for DB/network boundaries,
  - E2E only for critical user flows.
- Avoid brittle tests tied to incidental implementation details.

### 3. Type Safety and Invariants

- Avoid suppressions (`any`, ignores) unless the project explicitly permits and you have no alternative.
- Encode invariants where they belong:
  - validation at boundaries, not scattered checks.

### 4. Dependency Discipline

- Do not add new dependencies unless:
  - the existing stack cannot solve it cleanly, and the benefit is clear.
- Prefer standard library / existing utilities.

### 5. Security and Privacy

- Never introduce secret material into code, logs, or chat output.
- Treat user input as untrusted:
  - validate, sanitize, and constrain.
- Prefer least privilege (especially for DB access and server-side actions).

### 6. Performance (Pragmatic)

- Avoid premature optimization.
- Do fix:
  - obvious N+1 patterns, accidental unbounded loops, repeated heavy computation.
- Measure when in doubt; don't guess.

### 7. Accessibility and UX (When UI Changes)

- Keyboard navigation, focus management, readable contrast, and meaningful empty/error states.
- Prefer clear copy and predictable interactions over fancy effects.

---

## Git and Change Hygiene (If Applicable)

- Keep commits atomic and describable; avoid "misc fixes" bundles.
- Don't rewrite history unless explicitly requested.
- Don't mix formatting-only changes with behavioral changes unless the repo standard requires it.
- Treat generated files carefully:
  - only commit them if the project expects it.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

A task is done when:

- Behavior matches acceptance criteria.
- Tests/lint/typecheck/build (as relevant) pass or you have a documented reason they were not run.
- Risky changes have a rollback/flag strategy (when applicable).
- The code follows existing conventions and is readable.
- A short verification story exists: "what changed + how we know it works."

---

## Templates

### Plan Template (Paste into `tasks/todo.md`)

- [ ] Restate goal + acceptance criteria
- [ ] Locate existing implementation / patterns
- [ ] Design: minimal approach + key decisions
- [ ] Implement smallest safe slice
- [ ] Add/adjust tests
- [ ] Run verification (lint/tests/build/manual repro)
- [ ] Summarize changes + verification story
- [ ] Record lessons (if any)
- [ ] Update `STYLEGUIDE.md` with anything you have learned that is not covered

### Bugfix Template (Use for Reports)

- Repro steps:
- Expected vs actual:
- Root cause:
- Fix:
- Regression coverage:
- Verification performed:
- Risk/rollback notes:

## Repository Context & Instructions (Dotfiles Specific)

### 1. Project Structure & Installation

- **Root**: `~/dotfiles`
- **Installation**: Orchestrated by `./install.sh`.
  - Uses `brew bundle` for system packages (`Brewfile`).
  - Uses `gnu stow` (via `./stow.sh`) to symlink configuration folders to `$HOME`.
  - **Stow Convention**: Folders in root (e.g., `nvim`, `zsh`, `tmux`) map directly to `~/` (e.g., `nvim/.config/nvim` -> `~/.config/nvim`).
- **Dependency Management**:
  - **mise**: Version manager for tools/runtimes (`mise.toml`).
  - **Homebrew**: System dependencies (`Brewfile`).

### 2. Neovim Configuration (`nvim/`)

- **Structure**: Lua-based (`.config/nvim/lua/`).
  - `init.lua`: Main entry point. **CRITICAL**: Loads config/options _before_ plugins to ensure correct leader key setup.
  - `config/`: Core settings (`options.lua`, `mappings.lua`). **Place global keymaps in `mappings.lua`**.
  - `plugins.lua` + `plugins/`: Plugin declarations using `lazy.nvim`.
    - Prefer defining plugins in `plugins.lua` or dedicated files in `plugins/` for complex setups.
  - `lsp/`: Custom LSP configuration logic.
- **Conventions**:
  - **Leader Key**: Space (` `). Defined in `config/options.lua`.
  - **Lazy Loading**: Most plugins should be lazy-loaded. Use `keys`, `event`, or `cmd` to trigger.
  - **Formatting**: Checked via `make format` (Stylua).

### 3. Shell Configuration (`zsh/`)

- **Plugin Manager**: Antidote (`.zsh_plugins.txt`).
- **Entry Point**: `.zshrc` loads `antidote`, then `starship`, then `.functions`.
- **Environment**: PATH modifications are in `.zshrc`. **Caution**: Be careful with hardcoded paths.

### 4. Workflow Rules for this Repo

- **Adding New Tools**:
  1. Add to `Brewfile` if system-wide.
  2. Add to `mise.toml` if version-managed.
  3. Symlink via `stow` if config is needed.
- **Modifying Keymaps**:
  - **Check Load Order**: Always verify `mapleader` is set before plugins load.
  - **Location**: Prefer `lua/config/mappings.lua` for global maps.
  - **Plugins**: Prefer `keys = { ... }` in `lazy.nvim` spec, but if issues arise, verify the plugin isn't loading before the map is set (or use `lazy=false` as a last resort).
